First of all, I like this domain because it's funny. It's always great to see all the ways politicians shove their feet in their mouths. But I also love the way it's built: even the typography is really nice. The rainbow of colors attached to each type of comment is clear but also bright and fun.

I like this visualizer, I guess? I saw it just while reading the blog of a friend. It looks like the author is just using this dot, with its sound, size, and movements, to visually chart genre? Kind of an interesting concept. It's smooth to watch.

This has always been one of my favorite sites to visit. It's so mystifying, and gross, and beautiful, and weird, and deep, and shallow, and everything all at once.
